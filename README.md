# headless-HERE-TTN
A set of python scripts that pull and assemble HERE and TTN Traffic and Weather data from nrsc5.
This is designed to be run as a cronjob periodically so you can see weather and traffic on a Home Assistant dashboard.

(This was vibecoded, but I did my best to clean up the code. Sorry.) 

Note: the TTN.py map and coordinate logic were adapted from an old fork of [KYDronePilot/hdfm](https://github.com/KYDronePilot/hdfm), licensed under GPL-3.

# Requirements:
- An SDR Dongle (Nooelec smart nesdr, rtl-sdr, etc.)
- A server running debian linux, Python 3, and Pillow (i.e. python3-pil)
- A working install of [nrsc5](https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5)
- An installation of Home Assistant with Samba access on a different machine

# What's included:
- [TTN.py](https://github.com/wryandginger/headless-HERE-TTN/blob/main/ttn.py)  - Runs nrsc5 for up to 5 minutes while the TTN weather and traffice data is received by your SDR. Once the files are received, nrsc5 stops and final images are assembled in ~/outputs/ttn
- [gif_ttn.py](https://github.com/wryandginger/headless-HERE-TTN/blob/main/gif_ttn.py) - Takes the TTN files located in ~/outputs/ttn and:
   1. Makes a copy of the weather image and saves it in ~/outputs/ttn/gif
   2. It creates a gif from the last 15 radar images
   3. Uploads the TTN traffic, weather, and gif to /config/www/ttn on your Home Assistant instance
   4. Cleans up / deletes the files you uploaded from the server
- [HERE.py](https://github.com/wryandginger/headless-HERE-TTN/blob/main/here.py)  - Runs nrsc5 for up to 5 minutes while the HERE weather and traffice data is received by your SDR. Once the files are received, nrsc5 stops and final images are assembled in ~/outputs/here
- [gif_here.py](https://github.com/wryandginger/headless-HERE-TTN/blob/main/gif_here.py) - Takes the here files located in ~/outputs/here and:
   1. Makes a copy of the weather image and saves it in ~/outputs/here/gif
   2. It creates a gif from the last 15 radar images
   3. Uploads the TTN traffic, weather, and gif to /config/www/here on your Home Assistant instance
   4. Cleans up / deletes the files you uploaded from the server
- [ttnhere.sh](https://github.com/wryandginger/headless-HERE-TTN/blob/main/ttnhere.sh)  - A bash script that first runs the TTN and then the HERE python files, takes a break and then restarts in an endless loop.


# How To Install and Run:
1. Download the contents of this repo to the home directory of your linux install
2. Edit ttn.py and/or here.py for your desired frequency and timezone. (This is automatically configured for Seattle, WA)
   - ttn.py requires tuning to an iHeartRadio station (95.7 MHz or 106.1 MHz in Seattle)
   - here.py requires tuning to an Audacy station (99.9 MHz or 100.7 in Seattle) or Bonneville station (97.3 MHz in Seattle)
4. Edit gif_ttn.py and/or gif_here.py for the IP and Samba credentials of your Home Assistant instance
5. Edit the ttnhere.sh script so it directs to the correct home directory
6. Optionally, you can disable TTN or HERE data in the ttnhere.sh file if you want to exclude one data source.
7. Run crontab -e (not as root) and add the following to the bottom:
```
@reboot /bin/bash /home/USER/ttnhere.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
```
7. To be safe, make sure you have a ttn and here folder inside /config/www on your Home Assistant installation.
8. Reboot your server and the ttnhere.sh script should collect the Traffic and Weather data every 5 minutes.

# Home Assistant Tips:
- Consider using a USB switch like the [Sonoff ZB Micro](https://www.amazon.com/SONOFF-ZBMicro-Zigbee-Switch-1-Pack/dp/B0CR1FTWT8/) to turn off power to the SDR between cycles. 
- A cooler SDR lasts longer and tunes in faster.
- Use the Filesize integration to monitor the here.gif file (here.gif is the last file uploaded in a cycle). Turn on the disabled "Last Updated" diagnostic sensor.
- Make an automation that is triggered when sensor.here_gif_size and last_updated changes. Turn off the switch for the SDR for 3 minutes, then turn it back on.
